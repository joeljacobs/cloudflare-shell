# cloudflare-shell
A shell script to manipulate CloudFlare entries

Requires curl

This script will allow you to add, delete, alter and list cloudflare records using the shell.

Just execute the script for usage.

You will also need to create a credentials file with your CloudFlare credentials. A sample has been included. I have added a .gitignore for any file named "credentials" to be sure you don't accidentally upload your credentials using git.
